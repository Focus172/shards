# Shards

Shards is a shell framwork that aims to unify different langauges and put make 
them user shells. Shards will allow for most scripting langauges to have acsess
to the same resources as a shell would as long as it is passed a valid op-code.
It is left up to implementation for who each language chooses to implement this 
but there are two in this repo as examples:
    - Stardust (the zig interactive shell)
    - Rushi (rustc with spice)


## Parsing

The code uses a trimmed version of rustc to compile your code to an AST (abstract syntax tree).
The AST is then passed to an interpreter which runs it. When you call a meathod the interpreter
checks for this (in order):
    - 1. is it a builtin meathod
    - 2. is it a part of coreutils package (optional dependency)
    - 3. is it there an .rlib in your rpath with that name
    - 4. is it in your PATH 
    - 5. interpreting as string (in some contexts)
    - 6. error

## Piping

When chaining operation is chained it will default to using a rust iterator over a pipe if it is 
supported. If not then it will fall back on a traditional unix pipe. Iterators provide args as 
they recive them and all process run in parelell. A long time in the fueture there is a goal to 
run code until it request the next unready arg.


## Goals

The main goal of rushi is to be dumb and have a bit of a giggle. However secondary, there is a 
goal that by knowing rust you can do everything on a computer and this is the next step in that.
I don't want this to be something that just marginally changes things like nuShell or fish and 
ends up feeling luke warm. This project is dumb is proud of it.

## Notes

I talked with a few people and asked them something along the lines of "if using a terminal was 
easy and you knew it was faster would you use it?" and all of them responded with no. This means 
that people are just dumb and as such there no reason to appeal to normies and make stuff "nice"
or "friendly". As such this shell is designed to be evil. 

## Interface

Shards handles reading input from the user. It then calls the parse function of
the backend and expects to have an ast returned the language including a shell 
command primative which will run a binary. Shards will handle all the optimizations 
and running of your ast and you only have to supply a valid one.

# Rushi

Rushi is an esoteric shell that aims to replace reasonable scripting langauges with rust, a 
syntax heavy language for systems and not 1 liners.

In a normal shell you would issue a command that looks like this:
```sh
selection = $(ls -a1 code | grep .rs | fzf -i -m)
cat $selection | tail

# or

cat $(ls -a1 code | grep .rs | fzf -i -m) | tail
```

In rushi it would look like this:
```rushi
let selection = code.ls(-a1).fzf(-i -m)
cat(selection).tail

// or 

cat(code.ls(-a1).fzf(-i -m)).tail
```

So much better right?

# Stardust
