# Shards
Shards is a shell framework that aims to unify different languages and put make
them user shells. Shards will allow for most scripting languages to have access
to the same resources as a shell would as long as it is passed a valid op-code.
It is left up to implementation for who each language chooses to implement this
but there are examples in this repo:
    - Stardust  (zigcc with spice)
    - Rushi     (rustc with spice)
    - Rush      (pure posix shell)
